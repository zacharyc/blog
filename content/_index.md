This is the website of zachary cohen (zacharyc). The name coming from the old unix idea of creating a username with first name and last initial. I've been using it is since the start of my career, nearly two decades ago.

This website contains information about me and my interests. Blog posts will rang in topic including the following:

- Software Engineering
- Acroyoga
- Cheerleading
- Photography
- Dogs
- New Years Resolutions
- Science Topics
- Opinions

Most posts are relatively brief, but every once in a while I'll dive into a topic. I also have a list of my [projects](/projects).

I will be updating the content of this site as regularly as I can.
