<figure class="wp-block-table">| Date | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 10/21/20 | 7/10 | Pretty good, or maybe the more recent stuff has been so bad that Iâ€™m just excited about this one. |
| 9/30/20 | 3/10 | Way too mellow to be effectively motivating for a day of work. |
| 9/29/20 | 7/10 | Classical, very nice and relaxing |
