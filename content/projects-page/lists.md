I recently finished reading Draplin’s book [Pretty Much Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Aaron-James-Draplin/dp/1419720171/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1T4Q2NMDCWJN&dchild=1&keywords=draplin+design+co.+pretty+much+everything&qid=1589305220&sprefix=draplin+des%2Caps%2C187&sr=8-1). He talks about his website and if you go to [DDC](http://www.draplin.com), you will see lists of [pretty](http://www.draplin.com/1998/01/things_we_love.html) [much](http://www.draplin.com/1998/01/things_we_hate.html) [everything](http://www.draplin.com/1998/01/things_we_like.html). Copying is the most sincerest form of flattery, so here I am making some lists.

### People I Want to Meet Someday

- Rose Marcario – CEO of Patagonia
- Tommy Caldwell – Professional Climber
- Aaron James Draplin – Huge fan of his design.
