In 2016 I discovered Acroyoga. It was an immediate fit for me and I dove in full force. The fourth class I was taking I was teaching (I got AcroFit Certified the same week I took my first class). There is something about the connection with the people you are working with that really resonated with me. To this end, I’ve pursued a teaching career, hoping to share the joy I experience in the practice with others.
