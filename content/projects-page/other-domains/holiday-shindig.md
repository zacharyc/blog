Welcome to the Holiday Season!

Here’s the deal. I’m renting the bar, and it’s open bar. We start at 4 and go as long as we can stomach it, I’m not leaving before 11. The place is ours. You don’t need to come for the whole time, but stopping by would be great. The bar is a beer and wine bar and I will make sure there is a cider option as well. It has a rotating tap so I’m not exactly sure what will be on tap, but the main taps are Palo Alto Brewing Company taps, they tend to have a diverse palette and a good number of IPAs for people with traditional California tastes.

Everyone’s invited(21 and over). If you have a friend or two you want to bring, bring them. If I forgot to invite someone, please don’t hold it<span class="text_exposed_show">against me, I have a long list of friends and I just missed some that were local. Invite them to facebook, send me a note if they don’t have facebook, I’m just looking to get an accurate count of people attending. New friends or old friends, everyone is invited.</span>

There is no official theme, but if you have a fun holiday sweater, feel free to wear it, I will hopefully be wearing something festive, so you will be in good company.

Lastly, like I said, it’s effectively open bar that is coming out of my pocket. I would rather have you come than not come, but if you want to contribute, you can send me a couple of bucks to my paypal or venmo, if money is the issue, don’t pay, come hang out.
