Aside from my daily work, I sometimes work on side projects. They range from technical coding side projects to volunteer projects with local groups.

## [Cheer SF State](http://www.cheersfstate.com)

As a member of the coaching staff, we have been working for 8+ years to really turn this program into a serious collegiate cheerleading team. There are a lot of challenges in this process: changing stunt technique; convincing the school of our value; building a stronger work ethic, and dealing with constant coaching changes. Despite the challenges, we have brought the program to a collegiate competitive level and really established ourselves as one of the premier college cheerleading programs in the bay.
