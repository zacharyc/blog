[![Goggles And Board](/assets/img/2008/03/gogglesandboard.jpg?w=1100&ssl=1)](/assets/img/2008/03/gogglesandboard.jpg?ssl=1 "Goggles And Board")Last weekend I was “dragged” by some friends up to Lake Tahoe for some fun in the snow. So, I’m not as much of an ace as I thought I’d be, but I had a good time, and I hope to get better. It was a good time and I was with some good friends, and I wish I had a photo of all of us together, but I don’t. (Even though a few of my friends, who will remain nameless, managed to bring me down a double black on my second day of snowboarding in 2 years).

Also of note, I’m a northeast skier, so I’m used to hard ice and carving sounds. For the most part the snow was really soft of and nice. I wouldn’t say I’m convinced never to ski on the east coast again, but I did have a good time with the different snow.
