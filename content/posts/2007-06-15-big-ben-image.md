[![Big Ben](/assets/img/2007/06/bigben.thumbnail.jpg?w=1100&ssl=1)](/assets/img/2007/06/bigben.jpg?ssl=1 "Big Ben")  
This photo was taken in my trip to London in April. I liked this photo because of the colors and the location. It was taken with a Nikon D70s, and my 17-55mm Nikon lense, ISO 200, 1/160 of a second at an aperture of 6.3. Until I figure out which license I want to distribute these images under, please do not redistribute or use these images without getting explicit permission from me, the owner (thank you).
