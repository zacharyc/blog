I’m not much of a graphic artist, but I want to think of myself as a designer. Maybe just a User Interface designer, but a designer none the less. I want to create more personal works. Images, pictures, presentations, and website. I would like to “brand” these creations with a mark that represents me. I have always wanted to.

This “brand”ing mark would be personal logo. Logos are hard to create, and I’m no expert. This is my first attempt:

![Logo Take 1](/assets/img/2009/01/take1.png?resize=313%2C111&ssl=1 "Logo Take 1")

Would love some feedback about what you think. I’d expect there to be about 1,000 iterations before I finally find something I like.

The inspiration for this design is [Jason Santa Maria’s WordPress logo](http://jasonsantamaria.com/portfolio/wordpress/). Its easily recognizable, yet relatively simple. Clean and professional, but also personal.
