*This post doesn’t really have anything to do major concepts covered on this blog*

I was watching part of the [House](http://www.usanetwork.com/series/house/index.html) marathon on USA yesterday when I came across an interesting part of one episode. During the dialog one character asks another about the inner workings of their marriage with the patient.

The character responds by giving a very interesting explanation for why marriages don’t work. One of which I thought was very interesting \[[1](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0763992/quotes)\]:

> **Maria Palko:** Marriages don’t fail because couples get bored. They fail because, while they’re dating, people pretend to be the person they think their partner wants and then – well, there’s only so long you can keep that up.  
> **Dr. Allison Cameron:** Maybe they are that person when they’re dating, but then they change.  
> **Maria Palko:** People thinking their partner will change? That’s another reason marriages fail. People don’t change. At least not in any way that really matters.

I’m not expert on relationships but this does seem plausible.
