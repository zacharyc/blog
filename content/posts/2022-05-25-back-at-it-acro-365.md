After taking a very long break from my challenge I have started season two of my Acro365 Challenge. I guess this means the pandemic might be something we are moving past or at least learning to live with. Check out my instagram @zacroyoga for details on the challenge. Iâ€™m also working on an [Airkit](https://www.airkit.com/) App to keep track of the days and who is doing what.

One of the biggest challenges is that there are not a ton of local people who are super into doing acroyoga. On the west coast I could just ask people and most people would have experienced it. Finding people is going to be a challenge.
