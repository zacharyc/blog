Wil Shipley wrote a [blog post](http://wilshipley.com/blog/2008/07/mojave-experiment-bad-science-bad.html) on the Mojave Experiment whereby Microsoft “proved” that Vista is a great operation system. I think Wil makes a couple of really powerful points in his article, but there is one that I feel he leaves out. These people were shown what they thought to be the NEXT version of Windows. I think there is probably some tolerance built in for people looking at what they believe to be the next version. Something like, “If this OS was ready, they’d be shipping it already, so this probably just some sort of prototype.” If they said you had to use this OS, starting today until the end of time, I’m sure they would have had more questions and perhaps formed a very different view on the whole situation.
