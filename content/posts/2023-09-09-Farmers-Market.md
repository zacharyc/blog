There are two farmers markets a week on the island. Both are called the [Aquidneck Growers Market](https://aquidneckcommunitytable.org/aquidneck-growers-market), and have roughly the same vendors. Many are local to Rhode Island and you can get all sorts of great stuff there. I'm the worst farmer's market patron. I bring my over stimulated dog and pretty much only go to get a coffee and come home.

My two favorite places are: [Single Fin Coffee Co](https://www.singlefincoffee.co) (only on Saturdays), and [Navad Bakery](https://bunsbakeryri.squarespace.com). Both have finished products, so I don't have to cook.

Sometimes I will show up and do some acroyoga with friends.
