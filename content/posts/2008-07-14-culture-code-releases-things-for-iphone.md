Cultured Code Released [Things for iphone](http://www.culturedcode.com/things/iphone/). I have just download it and will start working it out tomorrow. I will say that I have been trying to start using things on my Mac, but it has been very hard to get up and running as I am not around my Mac all day. This App promises to change that, the problem. It doesn’t yet sync with the desktop client. They promise to fix this shortly, but until they do, I don’t think this app is really worth it’s value. However, with no purchasable version of Things for Mac available, I will take any opportunity I can to support the company, and buy this App.

I’ll let you know how it works out.
