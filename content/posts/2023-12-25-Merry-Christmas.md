## Merry Christmas to All!

This is a very special holiday many people around the world. It celebrates the birth of their savor. As someone who is jewish, I was taught in herbrew school to accept that there are multiple paths to G-d, and that mine isn't the only one that matters. So while I don't believe that Jesus was the messiah, I respect the fact that others do and I wish them a joyous celebration of their of the birth of the chosen one.

May your tree be full of ornaments and you get exactly what you asked for on this Christmas. May you also remember that Jesus message was about loving and kindness to each other. That we are here to be good to the people around us. This message rings of the old jewish belief that we are here to create G-d's kingdom here on earth. After all, Jesus started out jewish.

### And to all a good night!
