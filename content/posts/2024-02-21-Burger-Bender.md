This week in Newport, RI, is Burger Bender. It is an event by [Discover Newport](https://www.discovernewport.org) where local restaurants enter a burger into a week-long competition where diners vote on their favorite burger. This year, there are 52 burgers broken down into three categories.

Full details on all the burgers can be found [here](https://www.discovernewport.org/burger-bender/).

So far, I've managed to try five burgers, and when the week ends, I'll post my review for all of the ones I've tried. My current favorite is from [Yagi Noodles: Filet-O Ebi](https://www.discovernewport.org/burger-bender/yagi-noodles/), which was my first, but the bun did it. It's homemade.

This is my second week trying burgers, but my first year taking it seriously and attempting to get through a bunch of burgers and try more than just a few. Only several days are left, so it's a race to try as many as possible.
