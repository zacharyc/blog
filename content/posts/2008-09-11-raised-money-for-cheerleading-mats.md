I will be posting more posts about it, but Woodside High School Cheerleading Team will now be the proud owners of a FULL set of cheerleading mats. Seven panels, 2 inch thick, combined 42.5 x 42.5 foot cheerleading floor. Hopefully we will be able to do more tumbling and stunting, in a safer, better environment.

A large part of the funds came directly from the school including student, administration, and parent booster organizations. Thank you to all who helped!
