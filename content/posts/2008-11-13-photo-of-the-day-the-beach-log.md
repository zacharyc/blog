Recently I have just been posting a photo of the day with no content. Today, Iâ€™m posting three photos of relatively the same moment from three different perspectives.

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px">[![This Picture was taken so the log would be the focus](https://i0.wp.com/zacharyc.smugmug.com/photos/416262410_YUjdQ-M.jpg?resize=600%2C396 "Close Beach Log")](http://zacharyc.smugmug.com/gallery/6035965_mvCXN/1/#416262410_YUjdQ-A-LB)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This Picture was taken so the log would be the focus</figcaption></figure>

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px">[![This picture shows the same log with more foreground. I think the color of the log really makes it stand out.](https://i0.wp.com/zacharyc.smugmug.com/photos/416262369_GXX4s-M.jpg?resize=600%2C396 "Beach Log with more foreground")](http://zacharyc.smugmug.com/gallery/6035965_mvCXN/1/#416262369_GXX4s-A-LB)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This picture shows the same log with more foreground.
