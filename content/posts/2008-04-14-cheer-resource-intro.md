Cheer Resource is the name of my current web project. The whole goal of this project is to contribute to the cheerleading community by providing a centralized resource for cheerleaders, parents, and coaches alike to share knowledge about their programs and experiences. There is much work to be done on this project, including refining our goals and design, but most of that will be posted on the project page:

Keep in mind that this is still a rough sketch, and this not what I do for full time employment. This is a “project”, or something I work on for fun. More details to come in the future. For now, I’m just excited to have set up a basic code base and database structure.
