*This is a the first in a new series of pet poetry, written in the voice of the pet in the picture. This was inspired by the book **I Could Pee On This** which I highly recommend for the humor value.*

I see you there.  
I’m sitting here  
In my metal throne with arm rest  
I suspect you are up to no good  
I will find out what you are keeping from me  
And when I know I will administer the required sentence  
For I am the queen of this space I allow you to inhabit with me  
Do not test me…
