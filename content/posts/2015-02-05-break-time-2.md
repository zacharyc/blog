When I first started this blog many years ago, my intention was to publish here regularly. I have never kept that schedule. My posts are sporadic at best. I’m often quite busy and when push comes to shove writing hasn’t been as big a focus for me. Sometimes I take my notes in paper journals, other times just in my head. Well, I’m going to make an effort to return here. Make an effort to contribute more. I’m also going to make an effort to consolidate my different personalities here. I have a bunch of websites where I post photos. I have a several places where I post personal thoughts. I’d like this place to be a hub for all of it. Hopefully you will be hearing a lot more from me soon.

Break time… is over.
