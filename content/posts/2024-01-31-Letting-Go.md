Forgive the vagueness of this post, but this week has been a hard week where I've had to let go of a big commitment in my life. It's personal. I'm devastated and hurting, but I know this was the path forward. Letting it go was hard for me, and it comes with many complex emotions, including fear of abandoning people who depend on me. I'm shirking some responsibility that I had previously assumed.

This change is difficult for me to work through.

With the negative feelings, there are also positive ones. I'm free to attack some of the more significant challenges in my life without feeling like I've been held back by this commitment that wasn't good for me. Then I feel guilty for feeling free.

It's complex, and only time will make it better. I wish there were a fast-forward button on feelings, sometimes.
