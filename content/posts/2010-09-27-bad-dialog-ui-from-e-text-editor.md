I started using the [E Text Editor](http://www.e-texteditor.com/). Today I wanted to change the font to try something new. (I’m not a huge fan of Courier) Anyway, I get into the theme editing dialog (because that is where the font is stored, even though the font seems to be for all themes). It turns out that you can only get out of the theme editing dialog by clicking the close box at the top of the dialog, there is no “Ok” button. I’m smart enough to figure this out, but the interface is not intuitive.

Here’s a screenshot:
