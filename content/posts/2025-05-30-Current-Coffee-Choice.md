One of the best pure espressos I've had near me is from [Reprise](https://www.instagram.com/reprisepvd/?hl=en). After my work on [Hanukkah Coffee Box](https://www.hanukkahcoffeebox.com) I've decided that I want to dive into the process of making better espresso and perfecting it to a level that I haven't yet achieved before.

When I reached out to Nick at Reprise, he provided me with some valuable advice. Don't focus on small 1-pound bags of beans and try to achieve the right taste. It might take you a whole bag to dial in the flavor you want, and then you will have to recalibrate with the next bag.

Taking Nick's advice, I ordered 2 lbs of Olympia Coffee Roasters Little Buddy, or [HCB day 5](https://hanukkahcoffeebox.com/coffees/day5/), which was my favorite from the series last year.

So far, the experience is going well. I do love the taste of this particular espresso, and I am very much enjoying the process.
