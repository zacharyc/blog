Honestly, I was just happy to be a part of the event. I’m against hate and especially against religious persecution. This was an amazing experience, and while this video captures some of the magic, it doesn’t do it complete justice. The sheer number of people present on that little lawn was amazing. It was so hard to move around. There were so many people for the rally and maybe 10 for the WBC.
