Today my [CheerGyms](http://www.cheergyms.com) open team competed at a [Jamfest](http://www.jamfest.com/) nationals. This is the second year I’ve competed at Jamfest, funny that both of the times I’ve competed at a jamfest, my team won. Both times we competed on purple mats, though I hear they have other colors as well.

It was a good competition, though the awards were long after the cheer competition and they kept us there late. We were the only team competing in level six, so we won, but it was an empty win because there was no competition. Still the team started to come together, and I started to feel like a part of it. For the first time in a long time, I’m excited about next weekends practice.
