Not sure about how many of my fellow Villanova Alumni are working as a software or hardware engineer in Silicon Valley. I know a few. One of my friends, Arts &amp; Sciences 2005 is out here working on his own start up. Another ECE department grad is working for another software/hardware deal on security in SF. Not to mention John Hennessy, president at Stanford University.

In the mail today was another request to donate to the Alumni Fund and send in a note about where we are and what we are doing. While there is merit in sending this to the university, posting it here serves the same purpose in my book.

I’m working on as a senior software engineer for a start up RelateIQ that was recently acquired by Salesforce. I work on our iOS clients. Previous endeavors include Flywheel Software, Motorola Mobility, FactSet Research Systems, and Bloomberg. As an engineer I have experience with backend development in raw C++ and frameworks like Rails and NodeJS. I’ve helped develop a front end framework MontageJS, and have been working with iOS for the past two years or so.

Aside form my contributions to the tech world, I’ve been coaching cheerleading for San Francisco State University for the past four years, going from assistant to head coach, back to assistant coach. Before that I was at Woodside High School (which appeared in Waiting For Superman). I also cheer and help out at Rebel’s Elite Cheerleading Gym in South San Francisco.

In addition to coding and cheering, I can be found rock climbing at Planet Granite, biking on the streets of the bay, swimming in any pool I can find, eating out at local restaurants, or taking pictures of whatever happens to be in front of me.Not sure about how many of my fellow Villanova Alumni are working as a software or hardware engineer in Silicon Valley.
