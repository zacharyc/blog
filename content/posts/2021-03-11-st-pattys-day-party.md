It’s been a year since most of us started quarantining, and while there are many things we can’t do, we can still drink and celebrate the holiday. Teryn and I are hosting a St. Patty’s Day Zoom on Wednesday, March 17, at 7:30 PM Eastern until about 10 PM. Zoom link below. Depending on the number of people who show up, we will do some fun breakout rooms and a couple of other little games for the participants.

Happy St. Patty’s Day!
