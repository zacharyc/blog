I was searching the web and while I found many specific instances of calendars for various different programs, I didnâ€™t really find a generic template that I could reuse again and again, so I made one. The colors are set up to be orange and white because that is the colors of team I coach, but it can easily be changed.

I choose [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) because it is probably my most favorite drawing program. If you own a Mac, you should get a copy of this program.
