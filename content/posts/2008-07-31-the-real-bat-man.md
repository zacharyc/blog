At roughly 3 AM last night I started to hear the shutters above my head rattle. It would happen in waves. First it would shutter, then it would stop, then it would shutter and then stop. Very scary at first, then I realized that something was flying into them, and apparently making shutters rattle. I left the room rapidly, as I was in a state of excitement, and turned on the light from the outside, and peaked in through the door. I definitely saw something flying around. It appeared to be a Bat. I spent he rest of the night sleeping on the couch. Woke up this morning, the bat had apparently flown back out the window.

Things are conspiring to prevent me from getting work done.
