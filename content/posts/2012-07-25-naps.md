I saw this video on napping:

<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" height="315" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJ_f9onTTQE?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" width="560"></iframe></span></div>It occurs to me that there a several people I’d like to share this with, but my concern is some of these people won’t take the time to watch the video. To solve this problem I’m going to articulate the main points of it. Feel free to watch it, they probably say it better than I, but mine is written and theirs is in video form.

## Naps Are Good for you

This isn’t entirely the case, but basically, taking a nap is quenching your body’s thirst. Especially right after lunch.

There are four stages of sleep, Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep happens after you’ve been asleep for the a longer period of time. Waking up during REM sleep leaves you groggy, but taking a short power nap helps you wake feeling refreshed and leads to better

- Increased procutctivity
- Increased cognative function
- Enhanced memory
- Boosted creativity
- Feeling less tired

So, take a nap, but try to keep it less than 30 minutes. This will help you through the day.
