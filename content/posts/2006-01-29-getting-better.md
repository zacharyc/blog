Just want to post a note that I am doing better with my ankle. It is starting to move again. i did a \*little\* bit of cheerleading this weekend. Through a few girls around; did a cartwheel or two. That is a good thing since Iâ€™m competing on the leg next weekend :-D, but I will only be doing the simple stuff: Standing tucks, throwing a basket with Big Russ so i have to do no work and holding Idris up in an elevator. Generally speaking I will have an easy time relaxing and get another couple of weeks to recoup before the next big show.

I just want to point out that it is pure torture to hang out at the gym and not be able to tumble. AHHH!
