Momma, I love you.  
And not just a little bit.  
Like all the treats that you’ve fed to me love  
Momma, I know you know how much I love you  
Even when I’m barking up a storm during your yoga class  
It’s because I love you. I want the world to know my love  
Every time I shout from my tiny little (dare I say cute) dog lungs,  
It’s a cry of support and love for you.  
I cherish you, as I know you cherish me.  
It is surprising when you leave me behind to spend time elsewhere  
But it only heightens my energy to share my love for you when I get reunited.  
And momma, I love you like I love shoelaces.  
Both you and shoe laces are delicious.  
If you made me pick between the two, I would pick you, but it would be tough. Shoelaces are awesome.  
I love our walks, and especially the part where you try to get me move and we play our fun little game we play where I lie down in the shade.  
I know that secretly you are happy for the break, I can see this in all the barking you do at me in those moments.  
That’s when I know we are connected.  
We are the same, you and I, momma.  
See me here, in this moment, practicing on my belly like you do.  
I even have my tongue stuck out like you.  
Okay, momma, now that I have told you about my love, I will bark, and you will give me a treat!
