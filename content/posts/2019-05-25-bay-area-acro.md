For those who don’t know, I’m a little obsessed with AcroYoga. I found it about two years ago and I’m a certified Acro teacher now and teach at least two classes a week (hoping to pick up a third).

There are already a bunch of really great resources out there for finding classes. [Acromaps.com](http://www.acromaps.com) is one of my favorite. The problem I’ve found is that is often challenging to figure out what is current and what isn’t. I’ve gone to acromaps to find jams and hangouts that just don’t exist.

To that end I’ve created a website called [bayareaacro.com](http://www.bayareaacro.com). It is a simple website with a curated list of Bay Area AcroYoga classes. It is by no means comprehensive, does not include San Francisco or the East Bay (though I’d be open to changing that if someone wanted to the curator for those areas).

Hopefully you find it useful.
