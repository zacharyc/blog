These are my links for April 22nd from 21:01 to 21:01:

- [Deaths, injuries raise alarm at cheerleading's dangers – The Boston Globe](http://www.boston.com/sports/schools/articles/2009/04/19/deaths_injuries_raise_alarm_at_cheerleadings_dangers/) – This post talks about the importance of Cheerleading safety especially in the state of Mass. It is an interesting piece, but I feel that people who advocate safety for cheerleaders sometimes go to the extreme and over regulate the sport. My classic example is the double full, which used to be legal in college, but due to safety restrictions has now been made illegal. Many people were landing it fine, some weren't. Better training would be a better solution than complete restriction.
