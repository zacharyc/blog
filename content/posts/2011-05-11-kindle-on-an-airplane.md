Dear Delta (or any airline for that matter),

I should be allowed to use my kindle during landing or take off. People are allowed to hold their books, my kindle is lighter than a book. Nobody believes the old garbage about electronic devices interfering with the cockpit equipment. What about electronic watches? What about pacemakers. Are you telling me that all of this electronic equipment is deadly to a plane?

Seriously, come up with better reasons or allow me to use my kindle through the landing.

Sincerely,  
Me
