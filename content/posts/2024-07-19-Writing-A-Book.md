I've written about it before, but I want to [Write a book]({{< ref "/posts/2021-05-03-writing-a-book" >}}). I've wanted to for as long as I can remember. As someone who had such a challenge reading, creating something that someone else would read is an epic dream of mine.

Last year the [Wildsam Guide to Newport](https://shop.wildsam.com/products/newport) came out and I was immediately dissapointed. I remember reading through it and being like, "how can someone read this and appreciate the town of Newport?" It's reviews seemed to be written by tourists who had some and spent some time, but never really invested in understanding what makes Newport so special. The history sections read like book reports. None of it connected.

Last year the [Wildsam Guide to Newport](https://shop.wildsam.com/products/newport) came out and I was immediately dissapointed. I remember reading through it and being like, "How can someone read this and appreciate the town of Newport?" Its reviews were written by tourists who had spent some time but never really invested in understanding what makes Newport so unique. The history sections read like book reports. None of it connected. The maps were poorly drawn, and much of the town's history and understanding needed to be included.

There is also more to Newport than just downtown. People often use Newport to refer to all of Aquidneck Island, and some even include Jamestown. There is religious history, economic history, and restaurant history, and they are constantly changing. This town is one of the classic New England towns and has evolved.

Anyway, Wildsam missed this. Their rendition made me question their other guides. They are fun and pretty, but are they valuable and good information?

This has set me on the path to writing my own story about Newport, my guide. You might see more and more writing here on the blog as I delve into the questions I'm hoping to answer in the book. Eventually, I'll work on my ultimate project, a Newport App.

If you have ideas about what you would like to see in a book, please don't hesitate to reach out and give me ideas.
