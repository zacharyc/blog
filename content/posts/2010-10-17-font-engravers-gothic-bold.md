I’m starting a new category, and while technically it should be called a typeface, I’m using fonts. I’m a fan of typography. I think all great designers are. I’m not a great designer, but I have aspirations of being a better one than I am now. Anyway, I see fonts that I enjoy I will be mentioning them here for documentation purposes and hopefully to help others.

I recently ordered some boxer shorts from J. Crew. I received them and was caught by the typography on the belly-band. Here it is:

[![](/assets/img/2010/10/jcrewboxers.png?resize=300%2C262&ssl=1 "jcrewboxers")](/assets/img/2010/10/jcrewboxers.png?ssl=1)

There were some things that I really enjoyed about this label, especially in the font face. I really like the shape of the capital “B” where the top bubble is slightly smaller the bottom. Almost as if it is sitting on top. I like the width of the “R” as well. Gives the letter almost a subtle strength feeling.

It took a couple of attempts at [What the Font](http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/) to get a font that I think would be a good candidate for this font. I think it is [Engravers Gothic Bold](http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/engravers-gothic/bold/). Looks like a very nice font.
