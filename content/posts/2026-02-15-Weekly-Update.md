New initiative, write more about the weeks and share more with friends.

## Coffees

I’m in the Denver area and still hunting for coffee that works for me. Because this is my first weekly review, I’m going to include a couple from a couple of weeks back.

- [Lima Coffee Roasters](https://www.limacoffeeroasters.com/) - Fort Collins - Vibe was great, but my coffee was pretty poor for the cost. Didn’t have many naturals
- [Sweet Bloom Coffee Roasters](https://sweetbloomcoffee.com/) - Lakewood/Westminster - I love it when they do naturals, but until last week, they have had only six washed coffees and blends. Last week, they released a Gesha, but it looks like it is already off their site.
- [Coffee Ride](https://thecoffeeride.com/) - Boulder - I love everything about this place and mission, except the coffee was a bit of a miss for me; it could also have been the coffee I picked. I tried the [Colombia Finca Villa Betulia Honey Caturron,](https://thecoffeeride.com/collections/coffee/products/colombia-finca-villa-betulia-honey-caturron) and it smells like Ginger. First time I have ever had a coffee smell like ginger, but the taste is very Cardamom for me. I also tried the [Nicaragua La Bastilla Natural,](https://thecoffeeride.com/collections/coffee/products/nicaragua-la-bastilla-natural) and while it is a natural, brewed at 16:1, it still feels like a darker roast to me. I wanted more fruit. Despite all of this, I will go back and try another coffee there before too long. The shop is too cool. They started by delivering coffee on Bicycles!
- [Huckleberry Roasters](https://www.huckleberryroasters.com/) - Denver - This place has the same issue for me as Sweet Bloom. ALL OF THEIR COFFEES WERE WASHED. I got a 1:1; the barista was cool enough to make me one even though it wasn’t on the menu. The macchiato had no art. This doesn’t by default mean it is bad, but this one was bad, and the coffee tasted a bit burnt.
- [Verb Coffee Roasters](https://www.verbcoffeeroasters.com/) - Boulder - Saving the best of the week for last. This place has been on my radar before. Two years ago, we found it by accident while trying to go to another coffee shop in Boulder. It was hands down the best cup of coffee I had that year. Last year, I came back, and my coffee wasn’t anything special. I thought I had heard about them changing management or something, but apparently that was all in my head. Talking to coffee people at Sweet Bloom, I was encouraged to check them out again. So glad I did. Since I went a couple of weeks ago with family, I have been twice more and can’t wait to go again. I had a great [YEMEN - WADI JANNAT - NATURAL SL34](https://www.verbcoffeeroasters.com/products/yemen-wadi-jannat-natural-sl34). I also had the [RWANDA - NOVA WASHING STATION - ANAEROBICNATURAL RED BOURBON](https://www.verbcoffeeroasters.com/products/rwanda-nova-washing-station-anaerobic-natural-red-bourbon)

## Achievements

- Did a really deep dive on the process of the [Hanukkah Coffee Box](https://www.hanukkahcoffeebox.com/) and have some big learnings for next year.
- Added Ruff to a project I’m working on in Python thanks to a recommendation from [Ethan Hunt](https://ethanphunter.github.io/).
- Made some big changes to the ways event locations are handled for [Sacred Space][https://www.findsacred.space](https://www.findsacred.space/)]. This allows users to specify directions at their convenience, rather than an address. It also allows users to keep their address private until people sign up for the event.
- [Font Awards](https://www.font-awards.com/) for 2025 has finished, with Citywide as the winner, and I have set up the website to start accepting nominations for 2026. Any font created or redesigned in 2026 is eligible for the award.
- I am working on some of my leather crafting. I made a cover for my leather notebook with rivets.
- Started work on a new project that has the potential to change the way we deal with people through our technology.
- Discovered [Post Oak BBQ](https://www.postoakdenver.com/) and tried the Ron Swanson Sandwich Texas-style.
- I decided to start doing these weekly posts again.

I was sent on an errand to find swim trunks for a friend in Colorado in February. After 3 stores, we found options at Target!
