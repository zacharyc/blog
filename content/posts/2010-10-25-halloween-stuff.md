I got up this morning and started looking through facebook. I got upset that so many people had carved pumpkins this past weekend, but I had not. For the record, I’m not a huge pumpkin guy. Carving one involves getting your hands dirty which has never been one of my strong suits. Anyway, so I decided to make on in [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch). Here is draft one, and the source file for you to play with. It’s yours to do whatever with.
