When I was driving across the country I almost completely forgot that about the state of Utah. I just thought I would go straight from Colorado to Nevada. It turned out that Utah ended up being my favorite state to drive through. The scenery was AMAZING to say the least. Todayâ€™s shots are from part of the hills in Utah along route 70. I hope to do this drive again someday.
