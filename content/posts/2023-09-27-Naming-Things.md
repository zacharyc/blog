The book [Naming Things](https://www.namingthings.co) is a book about one of the hardest problems in software engineering, the art of naming variables, classes, methods and functions. This book was recommended on another resource that I'm unable to remember.

My general feeling is that this book would have been great earlier on in my software career. Many of the lessons covered are things that I have learned from other books or by making the mistakes myself. If you are thinking about getting into the field or just graduating college, picking up a copy of this book and reading it (which is quick, because it is less 100 pages), would definitely be worth it. If, on the other hand, you have read other coding practices books or spent years writing code, most of the concepts may seem overly obvious.
