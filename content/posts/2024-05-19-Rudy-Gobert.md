My journey into the world of the NBA began in Mountain View, where I shared a room with a passionate NBA fan. Prior to that, I was solely a college ball enthusiast. However, his enthusiasm was infectious, and over the years, I found myself becoming more and more engrossed in the game. This year, I've taken my fandom to a new level, tuning in to almost every NBA postseason game.

There are many compelling storylines in this postseason, but one hasn't been talked about much: the play of the Minnesota Timberwolves Forward Rudy Gobert.

Rudy Gobert, the Minnesota Timberwolves Forward, has been a part of the league for quite some time, having previously played for the Utah Jazz. His playing style, however, has always left me with mixed feelings. While he's undeniably tall and a skilled rebounder, it's his physical and, dare I say, dirty play that often goes unnoticed in discussions.

Earlier this year, Draymond Green was suspended for a technical foul he received on Gobert. The general consensus on the play was that Gobert did nothing wrong and was a victim of Green's aggression. My perception wasn't as blameless on Gobert.

As I watch him in the Nuggets series, I'm watching him be very physical. He pushes people (usually down low) on many plays. He ran into a player's arm and almost hyperextended an elbow. When he clears his space, his elbows are high. Yes, the number of people who have gotten hurt by him is less than some other players, but if you watch the action inside, you will see Gobert playing dirty.
