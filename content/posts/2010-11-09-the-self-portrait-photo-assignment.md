I’ve been searching for pictures of myself that I really like. And while I have a couple from friends that I find rather fun:

Anyway, I don’t have enough. And I’m vein. So this leads me to a self assigned project. The Self Portrait Photo Assignment. As with any assignment there are rules. Here are the rules.

1. Have to take the photo yourself.
2. Can’t buy additional camera equipment for this project.
3. Can’t buy any special clothing
4. Final product should be 5-10 different photos that are taken under different circumstances.
5. Photos should reflect your character.

I’m going to try to have my stuff done by December 1, 2010. Let me know if you want to join.

*Update: It’s taking longer than I expected to get around to this. Not going to have it done for December 1 (tomorrow)*
