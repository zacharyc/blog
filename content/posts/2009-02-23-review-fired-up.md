This is the new cheerleading movie about two football players who give up football camp for cheerleading camp to try and hook up with cheerleaders. Bottom line, not a great movie, wasn’t expecting much out of it, so wasn’t too disappointed. What frustrates me is that the joke content is very young, but the visual content is somewhat sexually inappropriate. That didn’t make for a great combination for me. That being said, there were a few funny lines and a ton of throwbacks to my childhood cheerleading experiences. The vote 3 on the Tubbs scale.
