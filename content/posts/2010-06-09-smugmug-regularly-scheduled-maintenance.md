Dear Smugmug,

I’m a user of your service, and while I’m very happy with the services provided, I started following the status update page and am a little concerned. Do you really need to have a regularly scheduled maintenance window where you can bring down your entire site? I understand that you are dealing with large quantities of data, but do sites like Google or Apple ever fully come down an regularly scheduled time? Do you not have redundancies? How safe are the images I store with you?

The constant downtime is a real concern for me and I’m considering switching back to flickr.
