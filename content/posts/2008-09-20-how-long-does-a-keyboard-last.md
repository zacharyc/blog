I have an older generation [Apple Keyboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Apple_Pro_Keyboard_(open_top).jpg) (this one is german, mine is standard US, but the design is the same and I don’t feel like taking a picture). The problem is, my spacebar key is starting to crap out on me (or I’m losing thumb strength and can no longer hit it as hard). I’ve had said keyboard for probably 3 years or so. Is it reasonable to be expected to go out and buy a new one?
