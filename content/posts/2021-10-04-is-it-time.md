When I moved to Newport, I left a teaching process in California where was teaching about three to five Acroyoga classes a week. Covid was growing more dangerous and the idea of being close to other humans in the Acroyoga context didn’t seem like the best idea. As weather got better last year, I started outdoor jams, they were at pretty terrible times (9 am on a Thursday), but at least they were happening. These events had a mixed success. There were larger gatherings of up to seven people, but for the most part they were small groups of two or three.

But **winter is coming** and the weather is getting wetter and colder. This means that in order to really grow we are going to have start looking for an indoor space. There are increased risks with indoor spaces and I’m concerned about bringing in new classes. The area I’m teaching has a high vaccination rate, and there seems to be a lowering of cases. The concern is, though, starting Acroyoga is challenge. It’s a challenge in times where Covid isn’t a concern. Is starting a class now just too much? What if I start it and have to cancel it due to covid concerns? This is stuff I’m worrying about and I’m just not sure. Anyone have any good ideas here?
