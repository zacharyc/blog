I saw this on [Devour](http://www.devour.com), this video embodies why I train for sports:

<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" height="315" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gHFhGDWP9Fs?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" width="560"></iframe></span></div>The video and the music are compelling, so watch the video, but here are the words:

> There are no grand celebrations here.  
> No speeches, no bright lights, but there are great athletes.
> 
> Somehow we’ve come to believe that greatness is reserved for the chosen few, for the superstars.
> 
> The truth is, greatness is for all of us. This is not about lowering expectations, it’s about raising them for every last one of us. Because greatness is not in one special place, and it is not in one special person. Greatness is wherever somebody is trying to find it.
