Recently, my mentor and friend Britta was selected as a spotlight ambassador for the Athletic Brewing brand.

You can see her spotlight [here](https://athleticbrewing.com/blogs/ambassadors/athletic-spotlight-britta-rael).

I'm particularly honored that her cover photo was taken during a shoot I did with Britta. Thank you, Britta, for using the photo.

For those of you who have yet to hear of Athletic Brewing, it is a non-alcoholic beer (it has a very small percentage) that people can consume that is tasty like beer but without the same alcohol level. Having tried several flavors, it wasn't my favorite, but as far as I can tell, I'm in the minority. Many friends love this brand. Some have switched from drinking beer to this.

In addition to Athletic Brewing, I want to highlight [Britta](https://www.brittarael.com). Britta is a fantastic trainer and a wonderful human. I can't thank her enough for her guidance as I became an acroyoga teacher. Her guidance shaped the teacher I am today.
