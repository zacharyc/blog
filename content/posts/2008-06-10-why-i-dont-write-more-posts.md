I often have ideas for good blog posts, but never get around to actually writing them. There are several reasons for this, but one stands above the rest. I hate large bodies of text. I hate reading them, and therefore I hate writing them for other people to read them.

There is nothing more annoying than trying to read a long block of text. Even in some of the blogs that I have followed in past, if they don’t break up their posts with diagrams or pictures or lists, I often have a hard time following.

So, here are the elements I try to include in my posts:

- Pictures – worth a thousand words
- Diagrams – used to explain what I mean visually
- Lists – outline content and pull readers to the important points
- Small Paragraphs – I like smaller, more direct paragraphs, though a bunch of these in a row can also be annoying.

I feel I need these elements to make a successful post. (Don’t ask me how I define successful, because I’m not entirely sure).

With that in mind I just purchased a [Canon 870 IS](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SD870IS-Digital-Stabilized/dp/B000V20S3G/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1213110882&sr=8-1) pocket-sized digital camera. Hopefully this will allow me to take more pictures and thus make more posts.
