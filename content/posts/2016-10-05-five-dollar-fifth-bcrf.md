It’s the fifth of the month. I started a thing a while back and have stopped doing it. I give $5 to charity on the fifth of every month. It makes me feel better. Five dollars isn’t that much.

This month, in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month, I’ve donated to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. They are rated A+ from Charity Watch.

You can donate [here](https://www.bcrfcure.org/?_ga=1.60004973.1733469366.1475688084). You can see information about the charity [here.](https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/breast-cancer-research-foundation/117)

The whole concept behind $5 fifth is that if we all did it would make a difference. If you can, please consider donating.
