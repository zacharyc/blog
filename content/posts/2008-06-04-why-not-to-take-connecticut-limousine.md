I recently returned for a visit to CT for the wedding of two of my good friends. And while the wedding was amazing, the ride from and to the airport was not. I decided to try the Connecticut Limousine at the suggestion of my mother. Bottom line I would not recommend them again. Here are some reasons:

- The are relatively slow
- They Pack more people into the van than is actually comfortable
- The shocks in the van’s they use are absolutely dead, and that makes for a very uncomfortable ride on the bad roads to and from the airport
- The air conditioning doesn’t always work

Add all these factors together and you end up with a rather uncomfortable ride. There are some good things. Their timing was pretty good, and the drivers were nice, but that is not enough to redeem themselves from the rest of the negative qualities.
