I post regularly on this platform with interesting things I'm doing, but I haven't written anything in May. There are several reasons for this. First, I'm working hard on trying to figure out what's next. While [Gluino](https://gluino.io) lives on, both Sean and I have decided to work in other directions. We still meet and work on it, but keep Gluino as a secondary interest rather than our primary focus.

So I've been open to doing anything else. I've farmed a bit. I've done some work on tiling and learning how to do some construction things. I've made some progress on a couple of sewing projects that I plan to talk about. I've spent a bunch of time with my wonderful dog. I've visited family and did the challenging task of prepping and selling the van. Oh, and recently, I had to replace all the tires on my car because one of them had popped.

I set up a workbench:

I'm still not done with the top of it. I've started moving more of the stuff I don't need every day out of my space to improve my productivity. I've gone to the gym a little bit, but not enough.

All in all, I'm dragging a little and have a lot of things that I wish I were doing that I'm currently not yet doing. I'm working on several web projects that I hope to discuss soon, and I'm trying to find more clients for my tech consulting business.

My last series of posts on Web Forms fizzled out because I was disappointed with the way DigitalOcean handles security around serverless and database connections. I'll still finish it, but I'll likely go to production with something like [form-data](https://form-data.com) instead.

More to come soon.
