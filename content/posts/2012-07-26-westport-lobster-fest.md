A couple weeks ago my brother approached me to help him with building a website for Westport Rotary’s Lobster Fest. I obliged and helped build the site at: [The Rotary’s Website](http://www.directory-online.com/Websites/WestportRotary/Pages/LobsterFestInfo.html).

I started off by sketching a lobster in Paper:  
[![](/assets/img/2012/07/lobster.jpg?w=600&ssl=1 "lobster")](/assets/img/2012/07/lobster.jpg?ssl=1)

Then I started thinking, my goals in creating the site were:

- Provide more style than the standard [rotary site](http://westportrotary.org/)
- Keep Westport Rotary looking professional, while still allowing the Lobster Fest to be fun
- Make the site clean and readable
- Use their Point of Sale (POS) system from Authorize.net

In case they take it down, you can see it on my [projects](https://zacharyc.com/projects/westport-lobster/). For a look at where it started you can see the old page [here](https://zacharyc.com/projects/westport-lobster/old.html).

All in all, I feel it is a big improvement. Here are some other things I would have done if I decided to spend more time on it:

- Use graphics to highlight the date (calendar), time(clock), and location(pin) on the page
- Provide maps to the locations to buy the tickets in person (though it is a relatively small town and this probably isn’t needed)
- Add the Rotary Logo
- Take some credit by putting my name at the bottom
