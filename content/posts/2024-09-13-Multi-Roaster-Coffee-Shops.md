Like other beverages, coffee is complex. Like the variety of wines out there, there are a large variety of coffees. Many things go into a cup of coffee. From the beans growing on the tree to the glass used to serve the beverage, countless factors affect the taste of your coffee.

As a coffee enthusiast who has savored about two cups of coffee daily for the past 15 years, I'm still on a journey of discovery. The coffee process is a complex web of factors, and this post delves into one small yet significant aspect: the role of roasting companies and how coffee shops make their selection.

Roasters take green coffee beans and **roast** them to the point where they can be ground and used in the coffee process. Many companies roast beans, and some are big enough to roast at several different locations (think [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com)).

I need to familiarize myself with the roasting process. However, I know that some people roast at home with an oven or even an old popcorn machine. Turning the bean so that the entire bean is roasted evenly is part of the challenge.

Most coffee shops are tied to a single roaster. Think of Starbucks stores serving Starbucks coffee. The same goes for [Blue Bottle](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/us/eng), which serves Blue Bottle coffee.

Here in Newport, [Springline](https://springlinecoffee.com) serves Springline Coffee beans. [Empire Tea and Coffee](https://empireteaandcoffee.com) serves beans roasted by Empire. [Custom House](https://customhousecoffee.com) serves beans roasted by Custom House. [Hill Market](https://www.hotelviking.com/dining/hill-market/) serves La Colombe Coffee.

While some roasters are big enough to produce multiple varieties of Espresso beans, they often have a standard for their espresso, and when you serve one roaster, you are stuck with a very standard espresso experience from that brand.

On the West Coast and in more significant markets, it is expected to find coffee shops that serve from multiple roasters and switch between what they serve. In smaller markets, this is much less common. Here in Rhode Island, I only know one shop that carries multiple roasters and switches between what they serve: [Simple Merchant](https://www.simplemerchantcoffee.com). At Simple Merchant I have had coffee from the following roasters to name a few:

- [Bolt](https://www.boltcoffeeco.com)
- [Brandywine](https://www.brandywinecoffeeroasters.com)
- [Dak](https://www.dakcoffeeroasters.com)
- [Dayglow](https://dayglow.coffee)
- [Enjoy](http://www.enjoycoffeeroasters.com)
- [Ilse](https://ilsecoffee.com)
- [Little Wolf](https://littlewolf.coffee)
- [Metric](https://metriccoffee.com)
- [No Vacancy](https://www.novacancycoffee.com)
- [Onyx](https://onyxcoffeelab.com)

Different roasters are known for different flavors. Some prefer a dark, strong coffee flavor, while others tend to have a light, fruity taste. While the processing method affects this, some roasters are better at one type. The variety of roasters allows you to try many different flavors. The next time you go into your local coffee shop, check to see who the shop serves and evaluate the coffee's taste before adding milk and sweetener.
