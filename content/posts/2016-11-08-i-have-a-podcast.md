I create a lot of things. I really enjoy starting projects. I’m not so good at carrying them through.

I started a podcast with my friend Evan to talk a little about climbing. We are both based out of the South Bay so we called the podcast [South Beta](http://wwww.southbeta.com). It’s a play on our location and route Beta. We have three episodes with no real purpose yet. That is the goal for the next episode, start putting some meaning behind it and start getting something to build for our listeners. Not quite sure what that is supposed to be.

Anyway, it’s an intersting listen and if you climb at planet granite it covers some gym related news. We also talk about going outdoors in this area and climbing tips.

If you have a chance, go to the website and check us out. You can also find us on iTunes.
