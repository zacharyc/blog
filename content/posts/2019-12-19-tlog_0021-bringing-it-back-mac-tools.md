Like the great Mr. Neistat, I have taken a very long break from writing daily. Having something important to share with the world is hard, and honestly, I don’t. There is nothing overly important about me. Nothing super unique about the way I think or what I experience, so finding something to write and share is not easy.

So on with the unimportant things I can share with you. Lets talk about the tooling I use every day on my computer that helps me get through all the work I do every day. These are tools that I’ve come to trust and when I go to another machine that doesn’t have them, I can get very frustrated. Here’s a list:

- [Flycut](https://roaringapps.com/app/flycut) – This is a keyboard manager that allows me to have a history of my text clipboard. This is super useful when you might need to copy multiple things.
- [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/) – This is a window manager. I have they board shortcuts managed. Only gripe is that the up spaces gets in the way of the Xcode change between .h and .m so I have delete that mapping. Other than that, this piece of software is a saver.
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) – This is what I wish the Mac text editor app was. Sometimes I even use this as a pass through to paste things into google or excel so it looses the format. I used to use text mate, but switched to sublime text and now it is a requirement.

There are many other little pieces that I use on a daily basis, but these three tools make the a Mac usable and without them I have a pretty hard time. Some other things worth noting:

- [oh-my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) with power line is awesome
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) for saving my files.
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) for shared stuff
- [Bear Writer](https://bear.app) for writing
- [Day One](http://www.dayoneapp.com) for all of my journaling (currently writing in it).
