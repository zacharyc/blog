Okay, so that's been a minute. My last post was from August. You would think that I've been doing nothing since then. False. I have had a lot of projects, just not all of them something worth writing about.

First up, a new edition of the [Hanukkah Coffee Box](https://www.hanukkahcoffeebox.com). This is the second year of the box, and I'm even more excited about the roasters. I had more time to plan (though I still managed to be late on releasing), and so I got some different roasters from around the country. There are a couple that were new to me last year and even a few that I haven't personally tried before. I have only tried a couple of them because the roasters asked for feedback, but they all smell fantastic. This year, I made about 50 boxes and have already sold about half. Head to the website to learn more about the box.

I'm working on a project that is aiming to fill some of the void I found with the disappearance of Acromaps. This project will allow people looking for different experiences to see them and connect, both in their community and while traveling. More on this coming later.

In terms of major projects, there is also the car auction consignment website [Authentic Auctions](https://www.authenticauctions.com), which is slowly taking off. Through Authentic Auctions, we work with people who are looking to sell their automobiles on auction websites. We take the magic out of it and help you through the entire process.

There is also a follow-up project on the Coffee Box for year-round interest. It will be focused on the use of analog tools and experiences. It will have to do with coffee, paper, and writing tools—more on this as it gets developed over the next little bit.

On top of all of this, I've been doing some construction with Rollin Renovations (website not available yet, though I'm trying to convince my boss we need one). This has been a real eye-opener on how houses are made and maintained. It's been awesome to start seeing under the hood of a home, fixing problems, and learning from people in a new area.

On a side note, I'm delving back into Ruby on Rails. It's been a while since I've played with it, and I know that a lot of people feel like it is old tech at this point, but it still has some powerful areas. While things like [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) are great, they are all independently added, and there is something about having your entire chain put together and tested as a whole. I have yet to deploy a Rails project fully, but hopefully will in the not-too-distant future, and we'll see how it goes.
