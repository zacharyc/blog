This picture was taken a couple of years ago at a fraternity event. Photographing fire has always been difficult. On one side you have something very bright, and at night, you are surrounded by the darkness. If you flash it, it can wash out. This is what I got.

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_154" style="width: 499px">[![Fire pit at a fraternity event](/assets/img/2008/08/fire.jpg?resize=499%2C330&ssl=1 "Fire")](/assets/img/2008/08/fire.jpg?ssl=1)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-154">Fire pit at a fraternity event</figcaption></figure>
