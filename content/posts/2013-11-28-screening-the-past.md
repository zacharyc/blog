It’s been over a year since I left my roll at Motorola working with a team of very talented web developers on [Montage](http://montagejs.org/). During my time with that group I worked on a side project for automated testing called “Screening”. I wrote a couple of posts (or at least one post) about chromedriver which we used to power screening. Still, one of the big personal accomplishments for me during that time was being published at Ars Technica. I was one of three authors on a post about the tools we were working on. The project has since been abandoned, but you can read about it [here](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/07/ninja-power-open-source-html5-toolset-hopes-to-unleash-the-web/).
