Last Night I went to a few WWDC after parties. This being my first year in the SF bay area, I wanted to make an effort to meet more Apple people, and while I couldn’t quite afford attending WWDC, I wanted to make it down there to meet some of the people.

Mike was planning on attending the [Webkit](http:// "http://webkit.org/") Party yesterday, but as the day wore on, he was less and less definite about his attendance, as he was already tired from a wild Monday night. So that left me with no one to go with. Now, I’m not overly shy, but I always like having a starting point in a crowd. Without Mike, I felt it would have been difficult to find that point (He works for Apple and therefore knows a bunch of people at webkit).

With Mike heading back, I saw yet another WWDC slipping away from me. I remember when I was really young and my grandfather took me to a MacWorld in Boston. That was the last Apple event I had attended, and I remember thinking how wonderful it was, but wanting to find more developers. WWDC was my next mission. I was about to miss the whole boat once again.

I had given up all hope, and committed to myself that I would try harder next year, when Kyle arrived. Kyle is a relocated employee at my company, who had just finished the drive across country. While my trip took about 7 days, his had taken only 4. He decided to make it into work early (why?). Well, turns out he is a Mac User, and with a little prodding was easily convinced to come attend the aforementioned Webkit party.

So we went, and it was amazing. I ran into a bunch of web guys who worked for the NY Times. They were really cool, and one of them even went to college with a high school buddy of mine, re-affirming my belief that we really do live in a very small world.

I also got to run into some cool Apple people, including [Mike Matas](http://www.mikematas.com/). All in all, it was a rather fantastic experience.

One last important note, while getting Subway on the way home we ran into this other gentleman, wearing what had to be the best shirt I saw there, “WYSIWTF” with an Internet Explorer logo. I have never seen a more true shirt :-D.

Hopefully next year I will be able to attend WWDC, not just an after party.
