It's Mid-July and there needs to be a life update.

Work wise, I've been working on some projects:

- [Authentic Auctions](https://www.authenticauctions.com)
  - Made with Hugo and hosted on Digital Ocean App Platform. Coding this from scratch allows me to make a bunch of the pieces reusable. As opposed to projects built with [WISYIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) builders, code reuse is much easier with this platform.
- [Dr. Ariel Palanca](https://www.arielpalanca.com) is a website I helped make for a clsoe friend for her practice out in San Diego area.
  - This was made with SquareSpace so much of what I did was in the squarespace interface. I find it combersome and hard to figure out, and not super intuitive to someone who is used to writing raw HTML and CSS.
- [Farmers Friend Greenhouse](https://www.farmersfriend.com/) Construction - I've been helping construct several large greenhouses for a local farm. It has been fun, but also very challenging. I built two last year and these are longer and were harder to construct. We are still not quite finished with the last one.
- [Newport Acroyoga](https://www.newportacroyoga.com) - Is one of my projects to bring Acroyoga to Newport, RI. I'm now on what I consider to be my third iteration of students going through the program, and I'm looking to find a way to grow the program and bring in more students. Going to look at redoing the website and social and bringing some things together.
- [Zack's Packs and Gear Repair](https://www.zackspacks.com/) - I've been doing some sewing work for Zack's Packs and making some more tool rolls for [Kingspoke Custom](https://www.kingspokecustom.com).

I've also been playing around with [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com) for coding and writing. In fact, this post was crafted in Windsurf. While it is a powerful tool, it doesn't solve the need for me to oversee what it's doing. I do believe it is making me a little faster, but I would relate it to Dan Harris' [10% Happier](https://www.danharris.com/p/books-ee0). It makes me about 10% faster, and 10% more productive.

I'm also starting to work on the update for [Hanukkah Coffee Box](https://www.hanukkahcoffeebox.com) project for next year. It starts earlier this year, December 14, 2025. So I guess it's like Jewish Christmas in July for me.
