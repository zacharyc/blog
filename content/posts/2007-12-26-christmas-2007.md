Another Christmas adventure. This year I spent the holiday with my family up in [Killingon, VT](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=killington,+vt&ie=UTF8&ll=43.645516,-72.79747&spn=0.153037,0.274658&z=12&iwloc=addr&om=1). My brother put in a movie today called [Ski Patrol](http://imdb.com/title/tt0100631/). It just so happens that this movie, released in 1990 was my absolute favorite movie as kid. I must have seen it about a thousand times. Yet, I hadnâ€™t seen it in nearly 5 years.

You know what I learned? 5 years wasnâ€™t long enough, I still knew every word ðŸ™‚ Itâ€™s okay though, I had a very fun time watching, and it was great to spend some time with the family. Hope everyone else had a great holiday as well.
