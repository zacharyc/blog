[Steve Jobsâ€™ obituary](http://gawker.com/5042795/steve-jobss-obituary-as-run-by-bloomberg) was mistakenly released by [Bloomberg News](http://www.bloomberg.com) today. Bloomberg is a company that strives not to take a position on the market, but in this case, they actually caused the stock to take a sharp dip. They have since retracted the article and stated that they have no non-public information on the health of Steve Jobs.
