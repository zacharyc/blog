[![Picture of the Nexus Book](/assets/img/2008/07/nexus.jpg?resize=155%2C234&ssl=1 "Nexus")](/assets/img/2008/07/nexus.jpg?ssl=1)This book is definitely my favorite read on the subject of complex network analysis. Having had several projects that involve the study of complex networks, the topic was not new to me. I have read parts of [Linked](http://www.nd.edu/~networks/Linked/index.html), by Albert Lazlo Barabasi, and [Six Degrees](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.com%2Fbooks%3Fid%3DQFlVVERTd-MC%26dq%3DSix%2BDegrees%3A%2BThe%2BScience%2Bof%2Ba%2Bconnected%2Bage%26pg%3DPP1%26ots%3DQGv0KIzgVv%26sig%3DbpB09NvggWPQUTHgGnuvjL_RFnU%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX%26oi%3Dbook_result%26resnum%3D1%26ct%3Dresult&ei=pWiHSMb4BJiAeYrjhe0F&usg=AFQjCNFslwnztzoH_1n5oc2Wc378_9VDAw&sig2=lkv6ITcE9eYSmMcTtYM96w), by Duncan Watts. Both are interesting books, but Linked takes a turn towards the highly mathematical and I had some issues following. Six Degrees didnâ€™t do a good job of keeping my attention either. <a href="">Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Theory of Networks</a> broke the mold. It was a good read, contained my interest throughout the book and I left feeling like I learned a few things. Worth the read, pick up, enjoy it.
