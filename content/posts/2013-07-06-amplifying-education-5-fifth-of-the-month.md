This charity is a bit more specialized in the past. I tend to rally around Education, and this is tied to that, but is more directly associated with [Dispath](http://www.dispatchmusic.com), the band. They make great music and Iâ€™ve been a huge fan for about 2 or 3 years and seen them in concert several times. Along with their performances, they believe in community service. The current charity is called Amplifying Education, and they volunteer while they are on tour. The money raised is distributed to several worthwhile educational funds. So, here is [Amplifying Education](http://amplifyingeducation.org/donate), pass it on.
