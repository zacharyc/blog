I’ve always got a bunch of projects going on. Some of them are big and overarching and some of them are small and simple. Some of them are related to work and some of them personal. What if at the beginning of the month I talked about the projects I was currently working on and which ones I finished last month, would I get more done? Would I have a more concrete record of my goals, achievements and failures? I have a LOT of failures.

To that end here is a list of my current projects and some notes about them.

<dl><dt>Unpack + Settle In</dt><dd>I’ve relocated due to covid to the east coast. I have a bunch of stuff to unpack. Currently all the stuff is just thrown around the house. I need to find the permanent home for the stuff. I also need to update billing addresses and various other pieces of work here.</dd><dt>Van Cleaning</dt><dd>Clean out Claire and get her ready for the winter season and future adventures.</dd><dt>Taxes 2019</dt><dd>I’m very behind on getting my taxes for 2019 done. I have an extension, but I need to put together a full working document on them and figure out where I can deduct.</dd><dt>Dog Rescue</dt><dd>I have come to the conclusion that I’m ready for a dog. Now the challenge is to find one to rescue and bring them into my home. This may be done through fostering first.</dd><dt>The Newport Book</dt><dd>Working on putting together a photo book for Newport, RI. Still figuring out what this means, but is something I really want to get done. I love this town, want others to appreciate how special it is.</dd><dt>Covid Card</dt><dd>I’ve been very distant from my friends during the covid times. I’m looking to make a little gift card to send out to friends to let them know I’m thinking of them.</dd><dt>Journal Most Days</dt><dd>This is something I enjoy. I don’t know if I’ll ever go back and read the stuff I write, but I love having the notes and thoughts from younger me to refer to if I find stuff I need to think about.</dd><dt>Super Secret Work Project</dt><dd>Can’t really talk about what this is right now, but I have grand plans and hopefully will be able to share with you before the end of the month.</dd></dl>The goal here is to recap these at the beginning of month and update you as to progress throughout the month. Feel free to ask questions about these projects (if you know me and know how to connect).
