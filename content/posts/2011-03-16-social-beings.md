I saw this piece randomly.

It’s a TED talk form David Brooks (NY Times columnist) about the evolution of our social society. I picked up on it because my interest in college really focused around the power of social networks. This piece goes a little deeper. It talks beyond even our conscious networks, to our subconscious networks. This is an interesting aspect I hadn’t directly considered. This is not a scientific piece as much as it is an emotional one. I thought it was worthwhile.
