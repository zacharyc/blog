Iâ€™m not really sure if I like this photo, but I would love some feedback. I think it is slightly out of focus. I remember the feeling I had when I was taking this photo and that was a great feeling. I was on my own, in the middle of the rockies, breathing cool fresh air. The feeling is probably not enough to call this a great photo, but here it is regardless ðŸ˜‰
