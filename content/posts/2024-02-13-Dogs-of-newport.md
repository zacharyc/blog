Not wanting another project, I created another one: Dogs Of Newport. One of my goals for this year is to start retaking photos. Not just take pictures but also _make_ photos. Spend time trying to get something decent out of the box we call a camera. One of my favorite subjects is the dogs in the town. As a dog owner, a chunk of my daily is set aside to care for my four-legged best friend. During this time, I meet other four legged creatures around town. Some fantastic dogs are in town, and even more come to visit over the summer.

This Instagram [DogsOfNpt](https://www.instagram.com/dogsofnpt/) is about these beautiful doggos and their adventures around Newport, RI. Expect the photography quality to grow as I learn skills or wane as I begin to get overwhelmed with other aspects of life.
