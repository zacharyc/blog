This is a rough cost breakdown of my dinner last night:

| Item | Relative Cost |
|---|---|
| Greek Yogurt | $0.89 |
| Chicken | $2.80 |
| Green Pepper | $0.50 |
| Zucchini | $0.35 |
| Onion | $0.75 |
| Ginger | $0.10 |
| Lemons | $0.50 |
| Total: | $5.89 |

There are several items not included here. For this to be a full cost breakdown Iâ€™d need to compute the cost of spices I used: Herbes De Provence and Cheyenne Pepper; and the cost of the rice that I used to, but already head. The total meal actually cost me nearly double that, but I only ate half, so I have some left over for tomorrow.

Sadly, no pictures.
