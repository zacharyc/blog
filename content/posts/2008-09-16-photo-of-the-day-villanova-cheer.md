This picture was taken over a year ago at UCA College camp in Scranton, Pa (yes the home of the Office). Here they are competing their cheer. This was the last east coast college I have attended, and quite possibly the last camp I will attend, so this picture is special for me.

In terms of composition, all the kids are facing the crowd, and the hands are all up in the air. The background isnâ€™t really, but this was the best I could do. This brings up the difference between shooting composed shots and event photography. Sometimes you have no choice about your angle and you have to take what you can get, that is what happened here.
