Its official, I’m now a volenteer assistant coach for the St. John’s Cheerleading program. I’m very excited to be working with such a wonderful program and team. I have been helping out a few practices prior to camp and I will be going to visit them (and my college program, Villanova) at UCA camp tomorrow.
