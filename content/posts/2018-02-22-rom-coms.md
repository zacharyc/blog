February is the month of Valentines Day. If there was a RomCom (Romantic Comedy) month, February would be it. To that end I spent some time thinking about my favorite RomComs. Below is a list of my favorite RomComs. I was trying to put them in order, but they each have a special meaning to me. If there is one you feel is missing leave it in the comments.

- Roxanne
- 10 Things I Hate About You
- 27 Dresses
- Wedding Date
- Along Came Polly
- Love Actually
- Wedding Crashers
- Failure to Launch
- How to Lose a Guy in 10 days
- Serendipity
- Definitely, Maybe
- Grosse Point Blank
- The Princess Bride
