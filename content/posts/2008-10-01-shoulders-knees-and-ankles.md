Cheerleading has really taken its toll on me over the years. I can no longer tuck like I used to. My body is getting even older and stuff that was easy just six months ago is getting harder and harder on my joints. So I made an appointment to go see a Sports Medicine doctor. The results:

- Possible tear in the right rotator cuff, will need to get an MRI to confirm
- Possible tear in the meniscus on my left knee (though both of them are hurting), will be following up with Physical Therapy on them
- I need to see another doctor about my ankle

The good news is that the doctor didn’t feel that any of the issues I’m suffering from should prevent me from cheering in the near future, or make me more likely to end up in a wheel chair any earlier than could normally be expected.
