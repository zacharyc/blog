My Local Coffee Shop got an Onyx advent calendar for $200. Each day, it comes with enough coffee to brew about two cups (it is not designed for espresso). It's an exciting idea, but after looking around, I could not find a Coffee Calendar for Hanukkah.

In typical Zack fashion, I decided that meant it was time for me to make one. To make this happen, I'm trying to gauge interest. My goal is to make between 10 and 20 calendars this year. They will be essential, as I don't have time to make them overly elaborate. Hanukkah starts December 25th (yes, on Xmas this year), so I have limited time to get this to people.

If you are interested in ordering the coffee calendar, complete the form below:

Updates will happen when and if we have enough interest to make this a reality.
