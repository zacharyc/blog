I met a few great people today.

A few weeks back I received an email from the Headquarters of [Sigma Nu](http://www.sigmanu.org) about joining the Alumni Board at a local college. For those of you who don’t know, in college I joined the Sigma Nu Fraternity and met many great friends. The problem was that I was overly committed to cheerleading, and while I wanted to help the fraternity, I didn’t get as much of an opportunity to do that in school.

Today I’m all grown up, and I still do a lot of work with cheerleading, but I have more free time. I have been meaning to look up a local chapter and get involved. Headquarters beat me to the punch, by asking me to get involved with this board. What the actual commitment is, I have yet to completely determine, but it does not seem like it will take up too much of my time (maybe an hour a week or less), but will still allow me to give back.

The meeting was small, only three people who weren’t working for the fraternity showed up, but every one of the five total people there were form different chapters. This meant we had five different perspectives on what Sigma Nu was all about. It was really great to relate to these people and I hope we will get to work together in the near future.
