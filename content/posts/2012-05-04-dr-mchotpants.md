One of my very good friends successfully defended her PhD yesterday in mechanical engineering (really astrophysics, but they called it mechanical engineering). The only think I could think of all day was a logo. She made the mistake of saying that I could call her Dr. _anything_ once she graduated. Her new nickname from me is Dr. McHotPants. Here was the logo I drew for her:
