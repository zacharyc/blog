Oh, pardon me while ai snuggle  
I don’t want to start a tuggle,  
But this blanket is now mine  
Move and I’ll make you whine.  
This is my place  
Watch your face  
I need some peace  
To rest on this fleece  
I’ve had a long day  
I’m far too tired to play  
So let me be  
And you will see  
Tomorrow I will be more fun  
We will go out and frolic in the sun.
