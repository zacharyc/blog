Mecca of Snow + Ski

A great place for gaining chi

Not too far from Reno

Best enjoyed with a glass of Vino

Snow is better than the east coast

Good enough for this worthy toast

The air is so crisp and clear

So raise your very best beer

Lets start this off with the right level of cheer

Stand Up, get off your rear

Get your ass out here

Even if you are not near

Because this is the place

Come show your face!
