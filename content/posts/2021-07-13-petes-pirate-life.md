A while ago, I got into watching some YouTube creators, one of my favorite being [Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat). Through my constant watching, I discovered one of his friends [Peter McKinnon](https://www.petermckinnon.com). I don’t know what it is about Peter, but I have a love and hate relationship with his work. His videos are sometimes cool and cover cool things, but oftentimes they are just about obvious editing things or things that Peter himself enjoys. He takes a long time to get to a point that could be covered sooner. Peter’s product shots are very much touched up. Very little of it feels genuine and real. But his style is on point in my book. His love for coffee mirrors my own, and his desire to see the beauty and be joyous is something I strive for.

So for various reasons, sometimes I will watch a Peter video and often times I’ll skip it. The same with his instagram, until I discovered [Pete’s Pirate Life](https://www.instagram.com/petespiratelife/). This one collection of photos and products fits into what I love about Peter while keeping me away from some of the stuff I don’t. Through this instagram, Peter shows dark little corners of his life in striking photography. He also does these things called “Drops” whereby he sells fun products. Many of them are overpriced, but the limited nature of the drop makes me pretty excited to collect items. It works on me. To the best of my knowledge, no one has really put together a list of the products he releases with information on what they are and how to make your own or do something like it. I’m going to attempt to do that. Check out my product page on [Pete’s Pirate Life](https://zacharyc.com/projects-page/petes-pirate-life-treasure-list/).
