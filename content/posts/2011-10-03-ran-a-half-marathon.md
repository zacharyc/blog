I ran my first half marathon yesterday. Finished with a time of 2:32:52. To be fair the course was VERY flat, and it was completely supported. Still I feel like this was a great accomplishment for me. I’m not a distance runner, never have been, and being able to finish 13.1 miles is a pretty large distance. I’ve been collecting money for my favorite charity, Charity:Water. I raised $500 for a good cause. You can still donate:

Thanks again to all who have donated and also those who have motivated me to run this distance. Especially those who challenged me to run distances of this length.

As a fun piece of trivia, I was once a track captain, though I’ve never been a cheerleading captain.
