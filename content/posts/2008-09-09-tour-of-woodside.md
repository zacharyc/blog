For everyone who doesn’t know, I’m coaching a high school cheerleading team. That team happens to be [Woodside High School](http://www.woodsidehs.org). On September 21st, they are doing the annual [Tour For Woodside](http://www.tourforwoodside.com/). A road bike race starting and finishing at the school. The profits are donated to a foundation that provides for various improvements around the community and in the high school.

Please, if you are available consider riding in the race. I unfortunately, will probably not be able to make it due to the fact that I have practice that morning.
