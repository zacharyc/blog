A friend recommended I check out this band:

[Ryan Shupe and the Rubberband](http://www.shupe.net/index.php)

They are a bit bluegrass but also a bit country. I highly enjoy their music. I have been listening to them straight since yesterday afternoon when they were recommended to me. I would check out “Banjo Boy”, “Be the One”, and “Corn Dogs”. You can listen to the songs on their website.
