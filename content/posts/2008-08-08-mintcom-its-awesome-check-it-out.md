[Mint.com](http://www.mint.com) is a financial site that allows you to log into one system to see all of your finances. Basically, it is as if you were able to take all your separate accounts and move them to one bank view. It’s really quite interesting, and I”m excited about getting on top of all my finances on a daily basis.

Also of note, it has a really good feature to tell you if you are saving money or losing money over the past 6 months. Even though I’m still in debt, I was very excited to see that I was still going in the right direction!
