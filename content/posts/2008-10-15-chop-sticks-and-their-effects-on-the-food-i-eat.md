This is just a brief aside, but it occurred to me today that often times I will pick which restaurant I like based on the quality of the chopsticks they offer. Safeway, for example, gives out really bad chopsticks that never break cleanly. I end up with one huge nob at the end of one stick, and the other stick is a mini stick. The chinese food restaurant, on the other hand, gives out great chop sticks. They always break cleanly and are of good solid build that feel comfortable in your hands. Many of the Japanese restaurants also have good chop sticks.

I think it funny, yet sad, that I will enjoy a restaurant more based on their selection of chop sticks, but really, can you imagine eating a Michael Jordanâ€™s steakhouse rib eye with a plastic fork and knife? I choose the place with better chopsticks.
