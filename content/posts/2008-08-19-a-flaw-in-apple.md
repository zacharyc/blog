[John Gruber nails it](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/08/19/engst):

> Apple’s biggest problem isn’t with its product quality (which, overall, remains very high), but with its communication to customers.

If your reading this blog, you probably know that I’m a big Apple fan. I will stand up for Apple all over the place, but I have been increasingly frustrated with their communication, this needs to change.
