I love my dog. I spend a lot of time thinking about what I should be doing for my dog. One of the things I do is get my dog out twice a day, and usually to the dog park. In Newport, RI, that is hard because no dog parks exist. The closest is in Portsmouth, about 25 minutes drive each way. If we stay for about an hour, that is double the time when you include driving. Too much.

Luckily, there are some unofficial dog meetups at some dog-friendly places. Most mornings (especially on weekdays), Coco goes to the local park between 7:15 and 7:45 am to play with her friends. I will take her to Simple Merchant Coffee afterward if I feel like it.

We also get outside the last hour before the sunset. This is currently around 4 pm. During this hour of play, Coco runs around crazy. Getting her energy out is the most crucial part. A tired dog is a well-behaved dog.

Coco loves to play with other dogs. If you are in Newport and need the details on how to get outside and play with Coco, please reach out!
