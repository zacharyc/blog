A lot of my posts recently have just been posts about interesting things I have read on other people’s websites. This is another one of those posts. I’ve been catching up on [43Folders.com](http://www.43folders.com) recently and quite captured by Merlin Mann.

Today I say his [video on Creativity Patterns](http://www.43folders.com/2009/01/27/creativity-patterns). This video changed my entire personal perspective, about myself and about my abilities at least for the day. He’s a great speaker and the concept is motivating. Check it out if you haven’t, and consider reading/watching more of Merlin if you have the time.
