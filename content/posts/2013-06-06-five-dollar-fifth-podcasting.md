I saw a link on Daring Fireball the other day about the [EFF](http://www.eff.org) going after a case involving royalties on Podcasting. This whole patent troll thing has gotten out of control and to think that all podcasts might be subject to a fee just for existing is beginning to scare me. There was also an interesting show from This American Life about it.

Bottom line, this month, after taking a little brake, I’m back with donating $5 on the fifth. You can join me at the EFF <a>Help Save Podcasting</a> page.
