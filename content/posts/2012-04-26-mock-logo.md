This deserves a little bit of explanation. I found out that one of my friends started working for [Duarte](http://www.duarte.com/). I fell in love with their logo:

One of the creative projects I have coming up is designing a new favicon for this site. This seems like as good a start as any. I have a couple of ideas going forward, but this sketch was the start. It was made with [Paper](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper) for the iPad.
