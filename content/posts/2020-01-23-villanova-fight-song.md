The other day I stumbled across this awesome project by FiveThirtyEight: [Our Guide To The Exuberant Nonsense Of College Fight Songs | FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/college-fight-song-lyrics/) while googling for fight songs. I was a cheerleader in college and still have my fight song memorized. I went the Villanova, and our Fight Song was called “V for Villanova”. The words were as follows:

> “V” for Villanova, “V” for Victory  
>  “B” for Blue and “W” for White
> 
> For the Blue and the White we will fight!  
>  Fight! Fight! Fight!  
>  Fight for Villanova, Fight for Victory
> 
> For we’re out to win the fray;  
>  Villanova leads the way,  
>  With a capital “V” for Victory.
> 
> Vill-a-no-va, V-I-L-L-A-N-O-V-A  
>  “V” for Vic-tor-y, V-I-C-T-O-R-Y  
>  It’s a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye,  
>  and a “V” for a V-I-C-T-O-R-Y
> 
> “V” for Villanova, “V” for Victory  
>  “B” for Blue and “W” for White
> 
> For the Blue and the White we will fight!  
>  Fight! Fight! Fight!  
>  Fight for Villanova, Fight for Victory
> 
> For we’re out to beat the foe  
>  Show the en-e-my we know  
>  how to win with a “V” for Victory.

This isn’t included in the 538 study because it wasn’t part of the schools they selected. Regardless, I’ve decided to post the values for the CSV that they are using:

A couple of additional notes:
