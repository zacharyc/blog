For those of you who I haven’t told personally yet (or haven’t seen me update my facebook profile), I have moved across country. I moved from New York City to Menlo Park, CA. This is just one of a few pictures I’ve posted from my trip across country. This was picture was taken of the mountains of Nevada in the morning on my last day of a week long drive.

This was the first time I had ever driven across country, and I have to say it was quite an experience. I’d recommend everyone give it a try at least once (though not by yourself in a Penske truck in the middle of the winter).
