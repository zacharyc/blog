Some of you may or may not know about my side hobby: [Zack's Packs and Gear Repair](https://www.zackspacks.com"). Through this hobby, I have learned a lot over the past couple of years. While I'm still at the beginning of this quest for knowledge about sewing and creating, there are a couple of things I've learned.

I use mostly Tex 70 Thread, which is called size 69. This was the thread used in the course I took at Sterling Continuing Education, and it is still the thread I use most commonly. I use bonded nylon for almost all applications unless the thread will get heavy sun exposure. If that is the case, then I'll use polyester thread (still size Tex 70). I only have black and white polyester thread, but I have many colors of Nylon. This thread comes from [The Thread Exchange](https://www.thethreadexchange.com/miva/merchant.mvc?Screen=SFNT).

There are a couple of other threads I use for special functions. When using my [Speedy Stitcher](https://www.speedystitcher.com), I use the included thread which is called course waxed thread. This thread is bigger and stronger.

There is a last category of thread that I use called Whipping Twine. This is used in the sailing world to whip and secure ropes together. Whipping twine can be made from everything, but my favorite is French Dyneema whipping twine, which is very hard to acquire.

When I first learned about sewing, I vastly underestimated its complexity. This shallow dive into thread and its uses is very interesting to me.
