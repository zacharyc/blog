Just returned from a quick trip to Stowe, VT to visit a friend up there. It’s probably been about 5 or so years since I’ve really been up to the state, but I used to spend a bunch of time up there as a kid. My parents would drive us up to ski in Killington, VT. Before the journey, I couldn’t be sure if I’ve ever visited Stowe.

Long story short, as I did the drive up, there were landmarks that I remembered, like the Ben and Jerry’s building. So, I’ve been there before, but probably not when I have been able to drive.

## Places Visited and Reviewable:

While I didn’t have a ton of time there (I was only there like 36 hours or so), I did visit a bunch of places for food and shopping.

### Ranch Camp

The first thing Forest took me to was a place called Ranch Camp for lunch. This place is awesome. I got the Local salad and it was just great. While I think they are more known for their burrito’s this salad was on point. They also had some beer from Anderson Valley (from California), which is one of my favorite breweries.

5 / 5 Stars! Would recommend.

### Woodland Baking &amp; Coffee

Wasn’t overly impressed with the espresso machine from first glance, not a brand that I recognized. This led me to choose a cold brew, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. They use Carrier Coffee which apparently is relatively local.

The real win was the molasses buckwheat sugar cookie which was spectacular. I would definitely go back here again for more coffee and pastries.

4 / 5 Starts because I’m still somewhat on the fence about the quality of the coffee.

### Black Cap Coffee + Beer

Super huge line for this place in the morning. Didn’t recognize their machine brand or the coffee. Also got a cold brew and chocolate croissant. The line was out the door to get the coffee and I probably waited 30 minutes for coffee that was just okay. Its location is great, it’s right in front of the big Stowe Church. I don’t know if I would return.

2.5 / 5 Stars

### Stowe Sandwich Company

Got very high reviews on Yelp and I would confirm. Tasty place. I wanted one of the signature options, but they were sold out so I settled for the Thanksgiving meal. It was epic. Very tasty and the perfect amount of each. The one downside is that their hours were posted to 4 pm, but they closed early at 3:30 pm. Luckily we were there at 3:25 pm. Of note, the meal was pretty darn expensive. Two sandwiches, drinks, chips, and coleslaw for 41 dollars.

5 / 5 Stars, will return for more sandwiches.

### Salon Salon Photo Spot

Woke up early on the one morning in Stowe and went here for photos. Was pretty and because it was sunrise and a little past peak leaf-peeping season, it was pretty empty. It was also cloudy, but I wasn’t terribly upset with the photos I ended up with here.

5 / 5 Stars, will return.

## To Catch Next Time

### [Tiny House Hosted By AJ](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/46659350?adults=1&children=0&infants=0&location=Stowe%2C%20VT%2C%20United%20States&check_in=2022-04-08&check_out=2022-04-10&translate_ugc=false&federated_search_id=b71dfc76-7000-4574-9e1d-aec265d0f5b6&source_impression_id=p3_1634915563_gFsQ2IpuYPqdcJef)

This cute Tiny home is available on Airbnb and the view is amazing. You have your own private view of the water. Need to rent it for a night.

### Sunset Rock

Another photo location to check out! Upset I missed it, but honestly, both days I was up there were super cloudy and rainy.

### [Vermont Artisan Coffee](https://vtartisan.com/)

Saw this driving up need to stop and check it out. Didn’t get to do it during their hours this trip, but high on my list for the next trip.

## Thanks

Big thanks to [KitLender](https://www.kitlender.com/) for letting me check out their space and to my friend Forrest for hosting me around the town. His mom cooked amazing meals for us both nights and they were kind of enough to welcome me into their house.
