Last Sunday was the 75th Anniversary of the Golden Gate bridge. Aaron asked me to go take pictures with him from Marin. We spent the entire day up on the mountain, but we got some pretty amazing photos from the top. Here is one:

This photo was taken with a Nikon D300s (Aaronâ€™s) and my 17-55 DX F2.8 Lens.
