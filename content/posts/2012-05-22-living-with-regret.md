I saw this page/video yesterday on [Living with Regret](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/12/05/kathryn-schulz-regret-ted/). I was moved by it. I wonder how much of my anxiety is from regret. One of the things that increases regret is imagination. Though I might not exercise it as often (or in as healthy a way) as I should, I think I have a powerful imagination. This may cause me to feel a disproportionate amount of regret. Here are my notes from the video. Donâ€™t judge my spelling too harshly:
