This is an older project I never posted anything about. I met some people from a web company called [Uxebu](http://uxebu.com/blog/). On their website they had a line “97% Human”. I once asked them, what’s the other 3%? Is it Beer? Hence the slogan 97% Human, 3% Beer. I made a mock of a tshirt design for it. Here it is:
