# About Zack

## TL;DR:

Software Engineer who loves working in iOS, backend systems, and front-end frameworks. Passionate about projects that help people live better lives.

## Longer Story

I grew up on the east coast. Spending years in Westport, CT, Haverford, PA and Lexington, KY, with side trips to Newport, RI and Killington, VT. I consider all of these locations formative to who I am today. My father was in retail and you can read about it in [The Kingdom of Prep](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-kingdom-of-prep-maggie-bullock?variant=40530104057890) among other places. I have two younger brothers who both live in CT with wonderful neices and a nephew. My parents still live in CT.

When I was in 7th grade, my family had just moved to Lower Merion, PA and my father was buying a new computer. In his search he brought me to a place called **The Computer Store**, which funnily enough sold computers. There I met a host of people: Pat, Manny, and Chris who worked there. During my 7th and 8th grade years, these people would foundational in my long term interest, maybe even obsession with Technology. They taught me about the internet and how to use my computer. They helped with my education in the subject and eventually helped land me a job at an ISP. This was back in the day when an ISP was basically just an office, no crazy security or server rooms. The people at the ISP taught me more about computers and even gave me my first tech job.
