I watch a lot of movies and I have a penchant for older movies. I feel like it is worth it to pass on some my favorite movies from years past.

### Old Movies

- [RAD](https://bmxunion.com/daily/rad-full-movie/) – Great BMX movie that I grew up watching.
- [Aspen Extreme](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106315/) – Old school skiing movie that I grew up on. Lots of classics in this.
- [Ski Patrol](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100631/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) – by far my favorite movie as a child. Classic skiing movie.
- [Sidekicks](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105402/) – One of my favorite movies from childhood.
- [Airborne](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106233/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) – Another classic movie from childhood about inline skating. Great appearances by Seth Green and Jack Black.
