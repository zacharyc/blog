I sometimes have some crazy project ideas that I don’t have time to execute. I’m hoping to use this as a place to share them. If you take an idea and go off and make it happen, please let me know, but you don’t need to give me credit or anything. It takes almost nothing to ideate, the cost is in the implementation.
