Aside from my daily work, I sometimes work on side projects. They range from technical coding side projects to volunteer projects with local groups.

## Coding Projects

## Photography

Iâ€™ve loved photography since I was fifteen. I really enjoy taking pictures and capturing moments in time. I publish my stuff all over the place, here are a couple of photo profiles
