Aside from my daily work, I sometimes work on side projects. They range from technical coding side projects to volunteer projects with local groups.

## Hannukkah Coffee Box

The [Hanukkah Coffee Box](https://www.hanukkahcoffeebox.com) was a 2024 project to create a a collection of eight coffees that were packaged and sealed and sold as a collection. Each coffee was released on the website on the day of the Hanukkah. No religious stuff required.

## Photography

Iâ€™ve loved photography since I was fifteen. I really enjoy taking pictures and capturing moments in time. I publish my stuff all over the place, here are a couple of photo profiles
