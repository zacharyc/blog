I’ve been known to be not he discerning side. I’ve got unique tastes and often develop habits for what I like to do in a given place. When people travel they sometimes ask where I’ve been and what I’ve done. I’m also an engineer and love creating routines so I don’t have to repeat myself.

To that end, I’ve decided to start creating a couple of city guides. Look for them in sub links here. Hopefully someone will enjoy them. If you have additional places I should check out, drop me a note and let me know what I should try out.
